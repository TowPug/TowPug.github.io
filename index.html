Welcome to the TowPug blog,
a blog entirely deviod of life
created by a guy who doesn't really know how to set up a website

<h4>Setup - Saturday, December 22, 2018<h4>
  <p>So, today I set up this blog that most likely nobody's going to even look at. But I guess I'll have a bit of fun just writing and seeing what becomes of this.</p>
