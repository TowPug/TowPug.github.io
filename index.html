<strong><em>Cuphead</em> - Wednesday, January 2, 2019</strong>
<p>So I bought Cuphead. I must say, it is a great game. The graphics are great, drawn in a great style. The gameplay... It's very comparable to Hollow Knight in terms of bosses, but no annoying running around and losing geo, which <em>is</em> an essential part of the game, but it's very annoying sometimes. The bosses all have a clear method of defeat, and nothing is undodgeable. Even when you lose you don't actually feel mad at the game. </p>
  
<p>However, the difficulty curve is interesting. For someone like me that sucks at object prediction, Goopey le Grande was ten times more difficult to me than the other isle one bosses. Certain players who are better accustomed to a certain skill will probably find one boss drastically harder than the last. Some bosses aren't placed very well in the isles in terms of difficulty, but the bosses are always fun due to unique animation and creative attacks. 4.8 out of 5.</p>
