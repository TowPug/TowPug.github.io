      <strong><em>Skool</em> - Friday, January 4, 2019</strong>
        <p>So I had a Science Project. Scietific Method stuff. I had absolutely no idea what I was to do, so I took inspiration from a very, very old, classic experiment involving salt and water.</p>
        <p>I messed up the stupid, stupid experiment so many times, depleting the salt in my house to nothing.</p>
        <p>It doesn't really matter that the experiment is simple, as the grading is based mainly around how you aquire information using the scientific method, and how you display it. But I feel like the inability to get decent results from an experiment that is literally just freezing water, might, just might, mess my grade up.</p>
        <p>Right now I have a suffocating amount of projects that I haven't even named yet, and I <em>still</em> feel compelled to write some blog stuff...</p>

      <strong><em>Why I didn't enjoy Subnautica</em> (Spoiler Free) - Thursday, January 3, 2019</strong>
        <p>So. Subnautica.</p>
        <p>I learned about this game from the many Youtubers that played and reviewed it. They all basically concluded that the game was beautiful, it had a very in-depth plot, etc, etc.</p>
        <p>And I agree.</p>
        <p>However, when I played Subnautica, the amazing graphics and complicated plot hints were all overshadowed by how <em>slow</em> I was progressing. It was just so difficult to find things I needed, and I had no idea where to go or what to do. I had no idea what anything really was until I had invested an immense amount of time and energy into the game. Only then could I progress cleanly, with more developed and advanced equipment, and just as I was getting into it, it ended.</p>
        <p>So that's why I didn't like Subnautica's less than linear gameplay.</p>

      <strong><em>Cuphead</em> - Wednesday, January 2, 2019</strong>
        <p>So I bought Cuphead. I must say, it is a great game. The graphics are great, drawn in a great style. The gameplay... It's very comparable to Hollow Knight in terms of bosses, but no annoying running around and losing geo, which <em>is</em> an essential part of the game, but it's very annoying sometimes. The bosses all have a clear method of defeat, and nothing is undodgeable. Even when you lose you don't actually feel mad at the game. </p>  
        <p>However, the difficulty curve is interesting. For someone like me that sucks at object prediction, Goopey le Grande was ten times more difficult to me than the other isle one bosses. Certain players who are better accustomed to a certain skill will probably find one boss drastically harder than the last. Some bosses aren't placed very well in the isles in terms of difficulty, but the bosses are always fun due to unique animation and creative attacks. This isn't really a review blog, but I'd give this a 4.8 out of 5.</p>
